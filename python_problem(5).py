# now same as python_problem(3) this program is for multiplication 
a= 5
b=10
print(a+b)  #addition of two numbers

#this is the end of the program
a = 5 
b = 10 

print(a*b)     #multiplication of two numbers

#this is the end of the program 

# now we do the subtraction 

a = 5 
b = 4 
 
print(a-b)      #subtraction of two numbers

#this is the end of the program 

#now we do the division 

a =10 

b = 5 

print(a/b)      #division of two numbers

#this is the end of the program 

a = 5 
b= 10 
c = 15 
d = 333

print(a+b+c+d-d/2*0==0)
